? What is an algorithm ?
    Algorithms are steps to solve a problem. Here we learn techniques to identify the patterns in our problem so that we can apply the required algo.

? Space Complexity
    How much memory is used

? Time Complexity 
    how many primitive operations are made

* Common Time Complexities
    O(1) => constant time operation
    O(logn) => Base is 2 (generally). As the input increases the no of operations decreases by a fraction(generally by 2 or 3)
    O(n) => Linear 
    O(nlogn) => We have a linear loop and after every iteration the size gets reduced
    O(n^2) => quadratic
    O(2^n) => exponential
    O(n^^n) => Eg : nested loop
