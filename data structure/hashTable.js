/*
? Hash Tables
hash Tables are like books with index => Meaning we can reach out to values faster
These are unordered collection of data.
They are used for quick lookups
Can be implemented using maps, set, object.
Flexible keys => Strings, functions etc
Here keys are converted into memory address using the hashing function
Hash tables cannot be sorted
