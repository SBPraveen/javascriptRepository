/*
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. 
Graphs are used to model complex relationships between objects.
The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph
Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially.
 In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size.
